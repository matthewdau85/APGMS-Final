# Operations Calendar — DSP Number Pattern Pilot

Monthly checkpoints ensure the DSP number pattern pilot stays aligned with the
governance requirements for tuning, segmentation freshness, and mute list
audits. Each review is scheduled during the 90-day pilot window.

| Month | Meeting Window | Focus Areas | Owners |
| ----- | --------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Month 1 | First Tuesday (week 4) | \- Evaluate detection tuning adjustments<br>\- Review segmentation freshness dashboard<br>\- Validate mute list overrides and expiries | DSP PM, Detection Lead, Compliance Analyst |
| Month 2 | First Tuesday (week 8) | \- Compare KPI deltas vs. baseline<br>\- Audit segmentation cohort drift<br>\- Confirm mute list hygiene and justification tickets | DSP PM, Data Science, Support Ops |
| Month 3 | First Tuesday (week 12) | \- Decide on exit readiness<br>\- Lock tuning changes for GA<br>\- Final mute list scrub + retention attestation | DSP PM, Detection Lead, Compliance Analyst |

Add each session to the operations calendar with a standing 60-minute block and
attach the latest KPI exports before the meeting. Capture decisions and action
items in the pilot retrospective document (`docs/pilots/dsp-number-pattern.md`).
