# Platform Governance Roadmap

## Quarterly Review Cadence
- **Participants:** Legal (patent counsel + regulatory), Security (CISO office + detection engineering), Engineering (platform + ML operations).
- **Schedule:** First Wednesday of each fiscal quarter at 10:00 PT with agenda distributed one week prior.
- **Objectives:**
  - Validate that patented capabilities remain aligned with DSP requirements and documented system behavior.
  - Review updates to `docs/patent/platform-patent-draft.md` and confirm entries in `docs/patent/changelog.md`.
  - Audit compliance evidence in `docs/compliance/evidence/` and assign actions for any gaps.
  - Capture roadmap adjustments for subsequent quarters.
- **Outputs:** Approved meeting minutes stored in the compliance evidence folder, action register updated in the program management tool, and any patent updates noted in the changelog.

## Near-Term Initiatives (Q2 FY25)
1. Finalize automation for lineage verification reports feeding the compliance metrics package.
2. Integrate architecture diagrams with the design system for auto-generated evidence exports.
3. Expand chaos engineering coverage to include data poisoning and model exfiltration scenarios.

## Future Initiatives (Q3 FY25 and Beyond)
- Operationalize continuous monitoring of explainability API latency with automated ticketing on SLA breach.
- Incorporate regulatory horizon scanning insights into patent narrative updates.
- Develop self-service dashboards for stakeholders to track compliance KPIs in real time.
