## Engineering scorecard

| Capability | Rating (out of 5) | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| CI/CD | 5 / 5 | CI now gates end-to-end Playwright smoke tests, signs and verifies web build artifacts, and validates generated SLSA provenance for every change and release. |
| Supply Chain | 5 / 5 | Signed artifacts, SBOMs, container image scans, and a release workflow publishing assets only after signature and provenance verification lift automation to the top maturity tier. |
