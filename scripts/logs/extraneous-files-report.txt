APGMS extraneous file scan
Root: C:\src\APGMS
Generated: 2025-12-04 21:52:53

Heuristic:
  A file is considered 'extraneous' if its file name does not appear in any other
  text/code file under this tree (excluding node_modules, .git, dist, etc.) and is
  not in the always-keep list (e.g., package.json, docker-compose.yml).

Caveats:
  - Some files may be used implicitly by tools (e.g. entrypoints, convention-based
    names) and still show up here. Review manually before deleting.
  - Dynamic imports or runtime discovery will not be detected.

Total text/code files scanned: 484
Extraneous candidates: 19
