# GitHub Diff Attempt

- Command: `git fetch origin main`
- Result: `fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/matthewdau85/APGMS-Final.git/': CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`

Because the remote repository is unreachable from this environment, a `git diff` against `origin/main` could not be produced. The local branch `work` remains unchanged relative to the files present in this development container.
