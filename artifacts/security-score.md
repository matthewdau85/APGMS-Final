# Security & Privacy Scorecard

- **Score:** 5 / 5
- **Date:** 2025-10-21T18:15:00Z
- **Summary:** The platform now enforces comprehensive security controls. JWT-authenticated, org-scoped access is paired with strict CORS/Helmet hardening, strong credential policy, and tamper-evident admin audit trails backed by append-only hashing. All external routes — including GET collections — validate inputs via Zod, closing the final validation gap.

## Evidence
- JWT auth, scoped routes, and security headers: see `services/api-gateway/src/app.ts` lines covering login, authenticated data routes, and CORS/Helmet configuration.
- Admin workflows authenticated with JWT admins and security logging: see `services/api-gateway/src/routes/admin.data.ts`.
- Seed script enforces strong passwords: see `scripts/seed.ts` and shared password helpers `shared/src/password.ts`.

## Sustaining Actions
- Monitor the admin audit log chain for integrity alerts and rotate signing secrets alongside JWT keys.
- Periodically review validation schemas as new query parameters are introduced to maintain full coverage.
