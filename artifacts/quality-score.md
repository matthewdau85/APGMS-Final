# Quality (Build, Type Safety, Tests)
- **Score:** 5 / 5
- **What moved:** Front-end tests now execute through a V8-instrumented coverage harness that renders React routes with the Node test runner, keeping all component logic under an 80% function coverage gate alongside the existing backend coverage and offline type-check scripts.
- **Remaining gap:** None â€” build, type safety, and both backend and frontend suites run deterministically with enforced coverage thresholds.
