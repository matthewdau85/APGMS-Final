# Customer Success playbooks

These playbooks help the Success team deliver consistent outcomes across onboarding,
adoption, and renewal motions.

## 1. Onboarding playbook

1. **Kick-off call** – Align on goals, stakeholders, compliance requirements, and integration
   timeline. Share the [bank partner enablement packet](../partners/bank-packet.md).
2. **Configuration sprint** – Enable bank connections, set up role-based access, import initial
   mandates, and connect compliance evidence feeds. Document any custom reporting needs.
3. **Training** – Deliver two live sessions covering the Overview dashboard, bank line workflows,
   and the accessibility status hub. Record sessions and store in the customer workspace.
4. **Launch review** – Confirm success metrics, review outstanding integrations, validate
   accessibility and compliance telemetry baselines, and schedule the first executive business
   review (EBR).

## 2. Adoption playbook

- Run monthly health checks evaluating utilisation metrics, compliance evidence freshness,
  accessibility scan results, and predictive drift scores.
- Share insights via a curated dashboard and recommend next best actions (e.g., enable
  automated alerts or expand user groups).
- Partner with Product to capture feedback, prioritise roadmap requests, and feed insights into
  the accessibility research repository.

## 3. Renewal playbook

1. **Quarterly EBR** – Present value metrics (capital deployed, time saved) and highlight
   compliance milestones achieved using APGMS, including evidence automation ROI.
2. **Risk review** – Use the [risk register](../risk/register.md) to show how residual risks are
   trending down thanks to shared controls.
3. **Commercial discussion** – Confirm seat counts, additional workspaces, and any services
   required for the next term.
4. **Executive sponsor alignment** – Secure written sponsorship from the customer executive
   prior to issuing the renewal order form.
