# Terms of Service (draft for legal review)

_Last updated: 1 November 2024_

## 1. Agreement

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern access to and use of the APGMS platform, provided by
Birchal Technologies Pty Ltd ("APGMS"). By creating an account or using the services, the
customer entity ("Customer") agrees to these Terms.

## 2. Services

APGMS provides a software-as-a-service platform that enables capital utilisation monitoring,
workflow automation, compliance reporting, accessibility governance, and customer assurance
portal access. Features may change over time; material reductions will be communicated at least
30 days in advance.

## 3. Customer responsibilities

- Maintain accurate account information and designate authorised users.
- Ensure user credentials are kept confidential and not shared.
- Use the services in accordance with applicable laws and avoid storing prohibited content.
- Notify APGMS promptly of any security incidents or unauthorised access.
- Configure reasonable safeguards for any data exported via the Snowflake compliance telemetry share.

## 4. Fees and payment

Fees are invoiced annually in advance unless otherwise agreed. Late payments accrue interest
at 1.5% per month. All fees are exclusive of GST and other applicable taxes. Usage-based
add-ons (e.g., additional compliance telemetry feeds) are invoiced monthly in arrears.

## 5. Data usage and privacy

Customer data remains the property of the Customer. APGMS processes data solely to deliver the
services and as otherwise permitted in the [Privacy Policy](Privacy-Policy-draft.md). APGMS will
not disclose Customer data except to service providers or regulators as required by law. Aggregated,
anonymised analytics may be shared with strategic partners for benchmarking.

## 6. Confidentiality

Each party must protect the other party's confidential information with the same degree of care
used to protect its own. Confidential information includes financial data, TFNs, technical
roadmaps, and performance metrics. Exceptions apply for information that becomes public through
no fault of the receiving party or is independently developed.

## 7. Security commitments

APGMS maintains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards aligned to SOC 2 Type II and
the DSP OSF. Incident response is governed by the NDB runbook. Customer administrators may
request audit reports via the compliance portal and subscribe to compliance telemetry feeds.

## 8. Service levels

APGMS targets 99.5% monthly uptime for production services. Planned maintenance windows are
communicated five business days in advance and mirrored on the accessibility status hub. Credits
are available for uptime below the target and must be requested within 30 days of the incident.

## 9. Term and termination

The agreement begins on the effective date stated in the Order Form and continues for the term
specified therein. Either party may terminate for cause if the other party materially breaches the
Terms and fails to cure within 30 days of written notice. Upon termination, Customer may export
data via `/admin/export/:orgId` for 30 days before deletion and may request a final compliance
telemetry extract within the same window.

## 10. Warranties and disclaimers

APGMS warrants that it will provide the services with reasonable care and skill. Except as
explicitly stated, the services are provided "as is" without other warranties. APGMS disclaims
all implied warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## 11. Liability

To the extent permitted by law, each party's aggregate liability arising from these Terms is
limited to the fees paid in the 12 months preceding the claim. Neither party is liable for
indirect, consequential, or punitive damages.

## 12. Governing law

These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. The parties submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria and the Federal Court of Australia.

## 13. Notices

Notices must be in writing and delivered by email or registered mail to the contacts listed in the
Order Form. Notices to APGMS should be sent to legal@apgms.example.

## 14. Changes to the Terms

APGMS may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the services after the effective
date of updated Terms constitutes acceptance. If Customer does not agree, they must stop using
the services and notify APGMS within 30 days to discuss options.
