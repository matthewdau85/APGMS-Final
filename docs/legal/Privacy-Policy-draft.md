# Privacy Policy (draft for legal review)

_Last updated: 1 November 2024_

## 1. Introduction

Birchal Technologies Pty Ltd trading as APGMS ("APGMS", "we", "us") provides portfolio
monitoring and compliance automation services to institutional investors. This Privacy
Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information in
accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).

## 2. Personal information we collect

- Identification data: name, email address, phone number, job title, organisation.
- Financial data: bank-line utilisation metrics, mandate pipeline information, portfolio
  performance indicators.
- Sensitive data: Tax File Numbers (TFNs) where required for regulator reporting.
- Usage data: login timestamps, feature interactions, device metadata, accessibility telemetry
  (keyboard-only interactions, assistive technology opt-ins), and support tickets.

## 3. How we collect information

- Directly from customers during onboarding and ongoing product use.
- From integrated banking partners and third-party data providers where customers authorise
  the connection.
- Automatically through the APGMS web application and APIs, using cookies, access tokens, and
  opt-in accessibility telemetry scripts.

## 4. Purpose of collection and use

We use personal information to:

1. Provide and improve the APGMS services, including analytics, reporting, alerts, and predictive
   compliance drift insights.
2. Meet contractual obligations with customers and partners.
3. Comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including DSP OSF and ATO guidance.
4. Support security monitoring, incident response, and fraud prevention.
5. Communicate with customers regarding product updates, support, and compliance notices.

## 5. Disclosure of personal information

We disclose personal information to:

- Banking and funding partners where customers authorise data sharing.
- Service providers that assist with hosting, analytics, accessibility testing, and support (under
  contractual confidentiality obligations).
- Regulators when required by law or as part of authorised reporting obligations.
- Professional advisors (legal, accounting) for compliance and governance support.

We do not sell personal information. Any cross-border transfers are governed by binding
agreements that enforce APP-equivalent protections. We may share aggregated, anonymised compliance
metrics with strategic partners via a Snowflake data share; no personal information is included.

## 6. Data retention

Personal information is retained only as long as necessary for the purposes above. TFNs
are handled in line with the [Tax File Number SOP](../security/TFN-SOP.md) and are purged
seven years after a financing relationship ends, unless legal obligations require longer
retention.

## 7. Security measures

- Encryption at rest for databases and backups (AES-256) with key usage monitoring.
- TLS 1.2+ for data in transit, including mutual TLS for internal service calls.
- Multi-factor authentication for all staff and privileged access management via AccessHub.
- Quarterly access reviews and continuous monitoring for anomalous activity and predictive anomaly
  detection for TFN access.

## 8. Access and correction requests

Individuals can request access to or correction of their personal information by contacting
privacy@apgms.example. Our process is detailed in [docs/privacy.md](../privacy.md). We aim
to respond within 30 days.

## 9. Complaints

If you believe we have breached the APPs, contact privacy@apgms.example. We will confirm
receipt within five business days and aim to provide a written response within 30 days. You
may also contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). Accessibility
feedback submitted through the status hub is routed to the same privacy review workflow when
it references personal information.

## 10. Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email
and posted on our website. The "Last updated" date reflects the most recent revision.
