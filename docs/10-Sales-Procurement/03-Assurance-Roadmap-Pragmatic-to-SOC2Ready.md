# Assurance Roadmap: Pragmatic to SOC2-Ready

## Current state
- Controls are documented in docs/runbooks/ato-rules-maintenance.md and supported by automated validation ().
- Security posture relies on Fastify security headers, role-based auth guards, and documented incident/availability models.

## Roadmap
1. Map every manifest entry in  to a control objective and evidence pack.
2. Extend readiness scripts and  to output evidence references per tax year.
3. Add formal audit logging, data retention tracking (audit logs/evidence for 7 years), and SOC2-style monitoring of incidents.
4. Formalize procurement questionnaire artifacts (this folder) as living documents.

## Targets (best effort)
These are aspirational goals without certified attestations today. Continue capturing evidence via the runbook, maintain doc updates, and route SOC2 prep as requirements emerge.
