# Current Objectives (to be updated as we go)

Codex responsibilities for the current iteration:
1) Improve and test the prototype end-to-end.
2) Provide detailed feedback on failures and gaps.
3) Generate and/or update all required documentation and evidence outputs for:
   - Product requirements (Patent-derived)
   - DSP / OSF evidence story
4) Prevent backend/frontend contract drift.
5) Keep readiness green.

Definition of done:
- scripts/agent/run-agent-suite.sh exits 0 and logs outputs.
- Key docs are updated and internally consistent.
