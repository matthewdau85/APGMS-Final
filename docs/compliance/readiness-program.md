# Compliance readiness program

The compliance readiness program ensures APGMS maintains demonstrable alignment with
applicable regulatory, privacy, and security obligations. This document outlines the
operating model, cadence, and key metrics that govern the program. Reference the
[compliance documentation index](README.md) for a catalogue of supporting artefacts. The
maturity expectations referenced throughout map directly to the [compliance maturity
model](maturity-model.md), which defines the artefacts, automation, and governance
checkpoints required to sustain a Level 5 (optimising) posture.

## Program objectives

1. Keep the DSP OSF and privacy controls audit-ready with current evidence and predictive alerts.
2. Provide transparency to leadership on compliance posture, gaps, and remediation plans through real-time dashboards.
3. Embed compliance checkpoints into product, engineering, and customer-facing workflows with automated guardrails.
4. Continuously improve the control environment using telemetry, user research, and auditor feedback loops.

## Control lifecycle

| Phase | Description | RACI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identify | Inventory new regulatory requirements, product launches, and vendor changes that impact controls. | Compliance Ops (R), Legal (A), Product & Security (C), All teams (I) |
| Implement | Update policies, SOPs, and technical safeguards; ensure documentation is reviewed by control owners. | Control Owner (R), Compliance Ops (A), Engineering & Design (C), Leadership (I) |
| Evidence | Capture proof-of-execution artefacts, store them in the GRC vault, and link within `docs/dsp-osf/evidence-index.md`. | Compliance Ops (R/A), Control Owner (C), Audit (I) |
| Monitor | Track control freshness, outstanding actions, and risk trends using the metrics below and the automated monitoring stack. | Compliance Ops (R), Leadership (A), Risk Committee (C), All teams (I) |
| Improve | Conduct retrospectives after audits or incidents to refine controls, address systemic gaps, and update automation logic. | Compliance Ops (R), Leadership (A), Control Owner (C), PMO (I) |
| Optimise | Leverage predictive analytics and scenario simulations to anticipate control drift, adjust guardrails, and test contingency playbooks quarterly. | Compliance Ops (R), Risk Analytics (A), Security & Privacy (C), Leadership (I) |

## Control calendar

| Quarter | Core activities | Owners | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | Annual policy refresh, privacy notice review, vendor due diligence refresh. | Legal, Privacy Officer | Updated policies, signed vendor attestations |
| Q2 | Penetration test, ASVS control walkthrough, accessibility regression workshop. | Security Eng, Product Accessibility Guild | Pentest report, ASVS matrix updates, a11y action plan |
| Q3 | DSP OSF readiness assessment, business continuity tabletop exercise, scenario simulation of top residual risks. | Compliance Ops, Operations, Risk Analytics | Control health report, tabletop findings, simulation outputs |
| Q4 | External audit prep, SOC 2 readiness gap analysis, TFN SOP training, continuous controls improvement retrospective. | Compliance Ops, Security, PeopleOps | Audit binder, remediation backlog, training attendance log, automation roadmap |

All activities include a 30-day follow-up review to confirm remediation progress.

## Training and communications

- **Onboarding** – New hires complete compliance fundamentals, TFN handling, and accessibility
  modules within 30 days.
- **Role refreshers** – Control owners receive semi-annual briefings on relevant policies and
  SOP updates, tracked in the LMS.
- **Executive reporting** – Monthly compliance scorecard presented to the leadership team and
  streamed to the live Tableau dashboard, covering control freshness, outstanding exceptions,
  incident metrics, and predictive forecasts.
- **Feedback loop** – Slack channel `#compliance-help` monitored by Compliance Ops with a
  four-business-hour response SLA.
- **Community of practice** – Quarterly cross-functional guild summit reviewing lessons from
  audits, red-team exercises, and customer assurance requests.

## Tooling and integrations

- GRC vault (encrypted S3 workspace) with lifecycle policies enforced by Infrastructure.
- AccessHub workflow integrated with Jira for approval traceability and quarterly recertification.
- Evidence freshness tracker sheet automated via the worker service (see `worker/src/index.ts` for the job entrypoint).
- Tableau compliance dashboard referencing risk register metrics, accessibility SLIs, and
  forecasted risk drift generated by the analytics warehouse. Source queries are documented
  in `docs/compliance/scorecard.md` so that auditors can reproduce trend lines without
  relying on proprietary BI tooling.
- Slack workflow builder posts the monthly compliance scorecard summary into `#exec-weekly`,
  including any exceptions older than 30 days.
- ServiceNow integration automatically creates follow-up tasks when evidence freshness breaches
  are detected, linking to the owning Jira issue for context.
- Monthly scorecard snapshot documented in `docs/compliance/scorecard.md` and linked from the
  executive meeting agenda. Backups of the rendered PDF live under `artifacts/compliance/`
  with the same naming convention as the scorecard heading.
- Snowflake data share publishes anonymised compliance KPIs to strategic partners for mutual
  assurance reviews.
- Control-as-code library (`infra/compliance/`) enforces Terraform guardrails for critical
  resources with drift alerts piped into the compliance data warehouse. Terraform plan
  outputs are attached to the DSP OSF evidence index as immutable artefacts.

## Metrics and thresholds

| Metric | Target | Escalation trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evidence freshness | ≥ 98% controls with artefacts updated within cadence | Escalate to CISO if below 95% for two consecutive weeks |
| Training completion | 100% of control owners current | Report to PeopleOps if any owner lapses beyond 3 days |
| Exception backlog | ≤ 3 open compliance exceptions | Add to steering committee agenda if > 4 |
| A11y defect SLA | 95% of Level A/AA issues resolved within 2 sprints | Product leadership review if SLA missed once |
| Predictive drift score | ≤ 0.2 likelihood of control breach in next 30 days | Trigger scenario drill if ≥ 0.3 |
| Vendor assurance coverage | 100% high-risk vendors with live control attestations | Immediate vendor escalation if any lapse |

## Automation coverage

- **Evidence sweeps** – Nightly worker job compares artefact timestamps to the cadence matrix and
  files `COMP` Jira tickets when thresholds are missed.
- **Training alerts** – LMS webhooks push completion status into the compliance data warehouse;
  Looker alerts notify PeopleOps if any control owner is overdue for more than three days.
- **Policy attestations** – DocuSign envelopes sync to the GRC vault with signer metadata,
  allowing auditors to self-serve signature verification.
- **Exception lifecycle** – Jira automation enforces that remediation tasks carry explicit control
  identifiers and due dates before the ticket can exit "Ready for Review".
- **Predictive drift modelling** – Weekly job ingests telemetry from risk register trends,
  accessibility SLIs, and vendor scores to forecast control slippage, alerting owners via Slack.
- **Continuous control validation** – IaC guardrails run hourly checks against production
  infrastructure; deviations trigger auto-remediation scripts and attach evidence snapshots to
  the DSP OSF index.
- **Customer assurance portal** – Authenticated customers can view latest policy attestations and
  SOC 2 report extracts, reducing manual evidence distribution while logging access for audits.

## Governance

- The Compliance Steering Committee meets monthly to review metrics, approve exceptions,
  prioritise remediation work, and ratify automation roadmap updates.
- Minutes and action items live in Confluence `Compliance-SteerCo` with links to evidence.
- This program charter is reviewed every six months or after any significant regulatory change.
- Quarterly deep dives alternate across privacy, security, and accessibility domains to ensure
  holistic coverage rather than point-in-time audits.
- Supplier assurance outcomes feed into the agenda so that third-party gaps are tracked alongside
  internal remediation plans, with quarterly joint remediation reviews for strategic vendors.
- Annual external advisory review validates the effectiveness of the control optimisation
  backlog and benchmarks APGMS against peer organisations.
