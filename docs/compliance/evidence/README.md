# Compliance Evidence Package

This folder aggregates artifacts that demonstrate how the platform satisfies DSP-aligned governance expectations and supports the patent claims. Each document cross-references operational systems and audit controls for regulatory submission.

- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md): Describes system architecture and highlights assurance controls mapped to patent commitments.
- [`sops.md`](sops.md): Captures standard operating procedures for human oversight, incident response, and release governance.
- [`compliance-metrics.md`](compliance-metrics.md): Provides quantitative metrics collected across the stack to validate continued compliance.

All evidence is version controlled and updated in coordination with quarterly review meetings described in `../../status/roadmap.md`.
