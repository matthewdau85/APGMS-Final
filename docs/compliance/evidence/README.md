# Compliance Evidence Repository

Use this directory to store signed reports, workbook exports, remediation logs, and other artefacts gathered while executing the compliance plan in `../security-attestation-plan.md`.

## Structure Guidance
- `penetration-pia-threatmodel/`: artefacts from penetration tests, privacy impact assessments, and threat models.
- `ato-dsp/`: ATO DSP workbook submissions, control mappings, remediation trackers, and supporting evidence.
- `vendor-agreements/`: executed agreements, inventories, and negotiation notes for third-party vendors.
- `key-logging/`: key rotation configurations, forensic logging topology, monitoring dashboards, and attestation evidence.

Ensure sensitive documents are encrypted at rest when stored outside this repository and reference redacted copies here if full artefacts cannot be committed.
