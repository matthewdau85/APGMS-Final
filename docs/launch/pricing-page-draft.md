## FAQs

**Do plans include accessibility tooling?**
Yes. All plans ship with built-in accessibility scanning powered by axe-core and Pa11y, plus
manual review guides published in `docs/accessibility/report.md` and live status dashboards.

**How does pricing scale with additional mandates?**
Bank-line ingestion is included up to 1,000 lines per workspace. Beyond that, usage is
billed at $20 per additional 100 lines per month.

**Can we trial Pro+?**
We offer a 30-day pilot with sandbox data. Compliance sign-off requires a short DPIA
questionnaire before production access is granted, and pilot tenants receive weekly
compliance scorecard digests.
