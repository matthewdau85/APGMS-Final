# Compliance Oversight Procedures

## Human-in-the-Loop Review Scope
- Apply human review to all high-risk ML decisions affecting customer onboarding, credit risk, and fraud detection.
- Require reviewers to confirm input data quality, model output rationale, and adherence to policy thresholds prior to final action.
- Rotate reviewers quarterly and maintain role-based training certifications.

## Fraud-Review Escalation Paths
- Level 1 analysts triage alerts within 4 business hours; unresolved cases escalate to Level 2 investigators.
- Level 2 investigators coordinate with product security and legal for suspected systemic issues within 1 business day.
- Critical incidents escalate to the compliance steering committee immediately, with executive notification following the major incident playbook.

## Approval Evidence Storage
- Record reviewer decisions, supporting artefacts, and timestamps in the compliance case management system.
- Store related communications (chat transcripts, emails) in the secure evidence repository with retention aligned to regulatory requirements.
- Perform monthly audits to ensure evidence completeness, immutability controls, and linkage to audit trails.

## Continuous Oversight Feedback
- Summarise monthly review outcomes, false-positive rates, and policy deviations for the compliance leadership team.
- Feed findings back into model retraining roadmaps and control improvements with documented owner assignments.
- Track corrective actions to closure in the governance risk and compliance platform.
